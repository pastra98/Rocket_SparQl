# Experiments with DBPedia
This notebook was originally created for the [Data and Knowledge Engineering](https://mitloehner.com/lehre/dke/) course by Prof. Mitl√∂hner at the Vienna University of Economics and Business in May 2020.
The present and published version has been edited to focus exclusively on fetching data from the DBPedia Sparql Endpoint ([http://dbpedia.org/sparql](http://dbpedia.org/sparql)) and generating a html page based on the fetched data (the original version used SQlite for storing and querying data, which was presented using ipywidgets).

The generated html page can be found in `rockets.html`, and is also hosted on my [github page](https://pastra98.github.io/rockets/rockets.html).
